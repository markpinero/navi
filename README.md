## About
Navi is a life calendar designed to help you give your life perspective. It's shorter than you think and longer than you expect. Inspired by Wait But Why's [Your Life in Weeks](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), Navi shows your life in a table form. Each row representing a year, each week representing a column.

Navi represents a character from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, who helps guide you, the main character throughout his quest to save Hyrule. This app aims to help showcase your past, present, and future.
