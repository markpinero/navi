![Navi: The Life Calendar](https://github.com/remarks/navi/blob/master/client/public/images/screenshot.png)

## About
Navi is a life calendar that shows you your life, from 0 to 100. It's shorter than you think and longer than you expect. Each row is a year, each column is a month. Inspired by Wait But Why's [Your Life in Weeks](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html), Navi lets you tell your tale, with plot twists and happy endings included. It aims to help you showcase your past, present, and future.
